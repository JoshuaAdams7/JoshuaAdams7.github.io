# CompTIA Security+

CompTIA’s Security+ certification is widely regarded as one of the first steps that one can take when looking to make a start on their career journey into cybersecurity. 

## Outline

* General security concepts (12%) 
* Threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigations (22%) 
* Security architecture (18%) 
* Security operations (28%) 
* Security program management and oversight (20%) 

## Why should I attempt to obtain this certification?

Not only does Security+ give you great career prospects, allowing you to check the HR filter box for that cyber job you’ve been chasing, but it also helps you to build essential cybersecurity awareness, which is important not just for technical professionals but for professionals that work in all areas of business. 

In the US, Security+ covers you under the DoD 8140 framework, enabling you to work within a variety of security-based roles if you’re interested in a career with the DoD. 

## How difficult is the exam to pass?

Given my background, I would give this exam a difficulty rating of about 7/10 and class it as being moderately difficult – comparable to an associate-level Microsoft exam. 

* If you already understand computer networks (maybe you have passed CompTIA’s Network+ exam or have a background in networking), how they work as well as common network protocols, this should remain around this mark in terms of difficulty. 
* If you’re completely new to IT and haven’t yet secured your first technology role, this may be somewhat more difficult to pass. 

## What areas should I pay the most attention to?

* Know common network protocols, their associated ports and underlying transport protocols (TCP/UDP) - build flashcards for these. 
* Understand the purpose of Access Control Lists (ACLs) and have a base-level awareness of how you might configure these. 

## My Background

[My LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-a-99a4921a2/)

I’m a Computer Science graduate with an undergraduate degree in Computer Networks & Security, a postgraduate diploma in Cybersecurity, 5+ years working with technology including cloud and eDiscovery, and several cloud certifications (AZ-900, SC-900, MS-700, PL-300, etc.). 

## Approach

It took me approximately one month to study for and pass this exam. 

I purchased an exam voucher, booked the exam in and gave myself around a month. Don’t wait for the ‘right moment’, if you know you need to get that certification, set a date and proceed with your study plan! 

Some quick tips:

* Allocate time to study each day, even if it’s just an hour. You can do this by setting up a timer on your phone or smartwatch so that you’re forced to focus for that length of time. 
* Are you into fitness? Kill two birds with one stone by running through your flashcards on your phone during your treadmill time – it works, trust me. 

I spent just under a month working through Jason Dion’s Security+ course, then built out flashcards to use with Anki for memorising common network protocols – I leveraged Copilot.
